Launching a bot instance for a configuration
IMPORTANT : NEVER USE YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT TO AVOID GETTING BANNED
Always create a new wallet, login with it and email verify it on the axie marketplace, transfer only the WETH for the axies you want to buy, + the 0% fee

After launching an instance, Botaxie will keep filtering the latest axies listed, until it finds a match, and will buy it for you.
You can monitor the instance's progress and logs from the Instances page
